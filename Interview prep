Switch A and B without changing lines 3 or 4 

var a = 8
var b = 6

var c = a // c = 5 because a = 5 // adding a new variable gives a chance to switch a and b
a = b
b = c // now we can change b since we have a third place to store variables in c. without adding the extra variable this would not be possible.


print("My favorite number is \(a)!")
print("The coolest number is \(b)!")




[Coding Exercise] 

IF/ELSE

Every 4 years, there is a leap year. Leap years have an extra day in February to bring the total number of days up to 366 instead of 365.

The 3 conditions for any given year to be a leap year are:

The year is exactly divisible by four (with no reminder) then it is a leap year, unless:

If the year is also divisible by 100 (years ending in two zeros), then it is not a leap year, except if

It is also divisible by 400 (in this case it will be a leap year).

Hint: You can check Wikipedia for the conditions expressed in your native language.

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.

If in doubt you can check the year here:

Complete the isLeap() function to print "YES" if the input is a leap year and "NO" if the input year was not.


Solution:

//Don't change this
var aYear =  Int(readLine()!)! 


func isLeap(year: Int) {
    
   
    if year % 4 == 0 {
       print("YES")
    }

    if year % 100 == 0 {
        print("NO")
    }

    if year % 400 == 0 {
        print("YES")
    }
  
}
