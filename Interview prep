var a = 8
var b = 6

var c = a // c = 5 because a = 5 // adding a new variable gives a chance to switch a and b
a = b
b = c // now we can change b since we have a third place to store variables in c. without adding the extra variable this would not be possible.


print("My favorite number is \(a)!")
print("The coolest number is \(b)!")
